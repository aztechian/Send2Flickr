Send2Flickr
===========

Java app to migrate a gallery archive into Flickr.

I had used Gallery2 to host my own online photo gallery (way back when). I've since switched to using Flickr,
and had wanted to move my existing Gallery images (along with comments, descriptions, etc) to Flickr.
I started writing a Java application that would utilize the Flickr API for this.
